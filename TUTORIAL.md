# FlowState Tutorial

FlowState is a lightweight, DOM-native reactive state library. It lives entirely in the browser, has zero dependencies, and is built around the same event and shadow DOM primitives that the platform already provides.

---

## Core Concepts

### The Scope

Every FlowState instance is anchored to a **root element** — either an `HTMLElement` or a `ShadowRoot`. The root defines the **scope**: only elements that are DOM descendants of the root can receive state from that instance.

```
<my-app>          ← FlowState root
  <child-a>       ← inside scope, can watch/get
  <child-b>
    <grandchild>  ← also inside scope
```

When a child calls `FlowState.watch()` or `FlowState.get()`, it dispatches a `CustomEvent` that **bubbles up** the DOM. The first ancestor that owns that key intercepts it, stopping propagation. This means scopes nest naturally — a child component can shadow a key from a parent scope without affecting siblings.

### State is Immutable Between Updates

FlowState deep-freezes its internal values after every update. You cannot mutate state in place. All changes go through `state.update()`.

### Updates are Batched

Multiple `state.update()` calls in the same synchronous turn are **batched** into a single flush via `queueMicrotask`. Watchers and bindings are only notified once after the flush, not once per call.

```js
state.update({ count: 1 });
state.update({ name: 'Alice' }); // batched — one notification fires
```

`state.update()` returns a **Promise** that resolves after the flush completes, so you can `await` it when you need to read the post-update value immediately.

### Watchers fire immediately

When you register a watcher with `state.watch()` or `FlowState.watch()`, it **calls your callback immediately** with the current value. There is no "subscribe and wait" — you always get the current value on registration.

---

## Two Ways to Use FlowState

### 1. Vanilla — `new FlowState(root, config)` / `FlowState.create()`

For plain `HTMLElement` classes where you manage everything manually.

```js
import { FlowState } from 'flow-state';

class MyCounter extends HTMLElement {
  #state;

  connectedCallback() {
    const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });

    // ⚠️ Create FlowState BEFORE appending children.
    this.#state = new FlowState(this, {
      init: { count: 0 },
    });

    shadow.innerHTML = `<button id="btn">Click me</button>`;

    this.#state.watch('count', n => {
      shadow.getElementById('btn').textContent = `Clicked ${n} times`;
    });

    shadow.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
      this.#state.update(prev => ({ count: prev.count + 1 }));
    });
  }
}
customElements.define('my-counter', MyCounter);
```

`FlowState.create(root, config)` is identical to `new FlowState(root, config)` and exists for symmetry with the static API.

### 2. Component — `FlowStateComponent`

A base class for Web Components that handles shadow DOM creation, styles, template stamping, and FlowState initialization in the correct order automatically.

```js
import { FlowStateComponent } from 'flow-state';

class MyCounter extends FlowStateComponent {
  shadowMode = 'open';
  styles = CSS`button { font-size: 1.5rem; }`;
  template = HTML`<button id="btn">Click 0 times</button>`;

  flowConfig = {
    init: { count: 0 },
  };

  connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback(); // always call first

    this.state.watch('count', n => {
      this.shadowRoot.getElementById('btn').textContent = `Clicked ${n} times`;
    });

    this.shadowRoot.getElementById('btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
      this.state.update(prev => ({ count: prev.count + 1 }));
    });
  }
}
customElements.define('my-counter', MyCounter);
```

`FlowStateComponent` exposes `this.state` — the instance API returned by the FlowState constructor.

---

## The Config Object

```js
{
  init: {
    // Plain values — any JSON-serializable type
    count: 0,
    user: { name: 'Alice', role: 'admin' },
    items: [],

    // Computed values — functions of state
    // Re-evaluated automatically when dependencies change
    fullLabel: (s) => `${s.user.name} (${s.user.role})`,
  },

  hooks: {
    // Hooks are read-only shared values or callbacks.
    // Children call FlowState.get(el, 'doSomething') to retrieve them.
    // They are NOT reactive — watchers receive the hook value once on registration.
    doSomething: (arg) => console.log(arg),
    theme: 'dark',
  },

  options: {
    label: 'MyComponent', // shown in devtools
  },
}
```

### Computed Values

Computed values are declared as functions in `init`. They are **re-evaluated lazily** when their dependencies update, and watchers on them are notified.

```js
init: {
  price: 10,
  qty: 3,
  total: (s) => s.price * s.qty,
}
```

> ⚠️ **Known limitation**: Dependency tracking is **top-level only**. `(s) => s.user.name` tracks `'user'`, not `'user.name'`. Any update to the `user` object will trigger recomputation, even if only an unrelated nested field changed.

---

## The Instance API

The object returned by `new FlowState(...)` or accessible as `this.state` in `FlowStateComponent`.

### `state.update(patch | fn)`

Update state. Accepts either a partial object or a function that receives the current state and returns a partial object. Returns a Promise that resolves after the microtask flush.

```js
// Partial object
state.update({ count: 5 });

// Function (safe for values that depend on current state)
state.update(prev => ({ count: prev.count + 1 }));

// Deep partial — merges into nested objects
state.update({ user: { name: 'Bob' } }); // only name changes, role preserved

// Awaitable
await state.update({ count: 99 });
const current = state.get('count'); // 99 ✓
```

> ⚠️ Only keys declared in `init` can be updated. Attempts to add new keys are silently ignored (with a console warning). Computed keys cannot be updated.

### `state.watch(key, callback)`

Register a watcher. The callback fires **immediately** with the current value, then again whenever the key (or any of its ancestors) changes.

```js
const unsub = state.watch('user.name', name => {
  console.log('Name changed:', name);
});

// Later, to stop watching:
unsub();
```

Supports dot-notation for nested keys. Watching `'user'` fires when any property inside `user` changes. Watching `'user.name'` fires only when `name` changes.

### `state.get(key)`

Read the current value synchronously. Does not register a watcher.

```js
const count = state.get('count');
const name  = state.get('user.name');
```

Works for hooks too — `state.get('myHook')` returns the hook value.

### `state.through(shadowRoot)`

Extend the FlowState scope into a shadow DOM so that elements inside it can use declarative bindings.

```js
const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
this.#state = new FlowState(this, config);
this.#state.through(shadow); // scope now includes shadow
```

`FlowStateComponent` does this automatically.

---

## The Static API

Used by **child elements** to reach a parent's FlowState without holding a direct reference to it. Everything works via DOM events that bubble up.

### `FlowState.watch(element, key, callback)`

Register a watcher from a child element. The event bubbles up until it finds a FlowState instance that owns `key`.

```js
// Inside a child element's connectedCallback:
FlowState.watch(this, 'items', items => {
  this.render(items);
});
```

### `FlowState.get(element, key)`

Synchronously read a value or hook from the nearest ancestor FlowState that owns `key`.

```js
const deleteItem = FlowState.get(this, 'deleteItem'); // retrieve a hook/callback
deleteItem(this.#itemId);
```

### `FlowState.through(shadowRoot)`

Used when constructing FlowState manually — tells any parent FlowState instance to pierce its scope through a closed shadow root if you want to use get/watch or bind state under the closed shadow. Called from inside `connectedCallback`.

```js
connectedCallback() {
  const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'closed' });
  FlowState.through(shadow); // bubbles up to parent instance
  // or: this.#state.through(shadow) if you own the instance
}
```

---

## Declarative Bindings

FlowState supports declarative DOM bindings via HTML attributes — no JavaScript watcher needed for simple one-way binding.

```html
<!-- Bind state key 'username' to the element's textContent property -->
<span flow-watch-username-to-prop="textContent"></span>

<!-- Bind to an attribute -->
<img flow-watch-avatar-url-to-attr="src">

<!-- Nested key (dot → dash) -->
<span flow-watch-user-name-to-prop="textContent"></span>
```

FlowState queries for these attributes inside its scope and updates them automatically when the key changes.

> Dots in key names become dashes in attribute names: `user.name` → `flow-watch-user-name-to-prop`.

---

## Hooks

Hooks are callbacks or values passed down from parent to child via the state scope. Children read them with `FlowState.get()` or `state.get()`.

```js
// Parent
flowConfig = {
  hooks: {
    deleteCard: (id) => this.#deleteCard(id),
    theme: 'dark',
  }
};

// Child (in connectedCallback)
const deleteCard = FlowState.get(this, 'deleteCard');
const theme      = FlowState.get(this, 'theme');
```

Hooks are **not reactive** — `FlowState.watch(el, 'deleteCard', cb)` calls `cb` once with the hook value and never again. Use them for stable callbacks and config, not changing data.

---

## Common Patterns

### Parent → Children data flow

The canonical pattern. Parent owns state. Children watch it.

```js
// parent.js
flowConfig = {
  init: { items: [] },
  hooks: { removeItem: (id) => this.#remove(id) },
};

// child.js (connectedCallback)
FlowState.watch(this, 'items', items => this.#render(items));
const remove = FlowState.get(this, 'removeItem');
this.#btn.addEventListener('click', () => remove(this.#id));
```


### Component-local state

Each component can have its own FlowState scope for state that shouldn't leak to ancestors or siblings.

```js
class KanbanColumn extends FlowStateComponent {
  flowConfig = {
    init: { selectedCardId: null }, // local only
  };
}
```

### Functional updates for dependent state

Always use the functional form when the new value depends on the old one.

```js
// ✓ Safe — prev is a snapshot at flush time
state.update(prev => ({ count: prev.count + 1 }));

// ✗ Risky if called multiple times before flush
state.update({ count: state.get('count') + 1 });
```

---

## Timing Rules

These are the most common source of bugs.

### 1. Create FlowState BEFORE appending children

FlowState registers event listeners on the root. When a child element's `connectedCallback` fires, it immediately dispatches `flow-state-watch` and `flow-state-get` events. If FlowState isn't set up yet, those events have no listener and are silently lost.

```js
// ✓ Correct
this.#state = new FlowState(this, config);
this.#state.through(shadow);
shadow.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true)); // children init here

// ✗ Wrong — children connect before FlowState exists
shadow.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
this.#state = new FlowState(this, config);
```

`FlowStateComponent` handles this automatically in `connectedCallback`.

### 2. Static API only in connectedCallback

`FlowState.watch()` and `FlowState.get()` dispatch events that bubble up to a parent FlowState instance. That instance only exists once the parent is connected to the DOM. Never call them in a `constructor`.

```js
// ✓ Correct
connectedCallback() {
  FlowState.watch(this, 'items', cb);
}

// ✗ Wrong — parent not yet connected
constructor() {
  super();
  FlowState.watch(this, 'items', cb); // no listener exists yet
}
```

### 3. Await update before reading new state

`state.update()` is **batched via microtask** — `state.get()` immediately after returns the old value. Use the functional form to depend on current state, or `await` the update.

```js
// ✓ Read in a watcher (fires after flush)
state.watch('count', n => console.log(n));

// ✓ Await the update
await state.update({ count: 99 });
console.log(state.get('count')); // 99

// ✗ Race condition
state.update({ count: 99 });
console.log(state.get('count')); // still old value!
```

### 4. Initial notification is deferred one microtask

After `new FlowState(root, config)`, the initial watcher notification is deferred with `Promise.resolve().then(...)` to give children time to register their watchers. This means watchers registered synchronously after construction will receive the initial value, but watchers registered in a later macrotask may miss it.

---

## Scope and Shadow DOM

FlowState uses DOM event bubbling to locate the right scope. Shadow DOM normally blocks bubbling — FlowState handles this by dispatching events with `composed: true`, which crosses shadow boundaries. The `through()` call is what links a shadow root into a parent's scope for **declarative bindings**; it's not required for the static API (watch/get) because those events are already composed.

```
document
 └─ <my-app>              ← FlowState scope (root = my-app)
     └─ #shadow-root      ← through() links this in
         └─ <my-column>   ← FlowState scope (root = my-column)
             └─ #shadow-root
                 └─ <my-card>   ← watch/get bubble up through shadows
```

When `<my-card>` calls `FlowState.watch(this, 'theme', cb)`:
1. Event bubbles through `my-column`'s shadow → host → `my-app`'s shadow → host
2. If `my-column` owns `theme`, it intercepts and stops propagation
3. If not, `my-app` intercepts it
4. The first ancestor that has the key wins

---

## Devtools

```js
FlowState.devtools();
```

Call this once, early in your app entry point. It opens the devtools panel in a new tab and connects via `BroadcastChannel`. The devtools show all active FlowState scopes, their current state values, watchers, and the source element that registered each watcher. Clicking a watcher in the panel highlights the corresponding element in the app.
